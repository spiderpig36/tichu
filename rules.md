# TICHU

## TICHU NANJING (4 Players)

### The Cards
The cards consist of four suits (Jade/Swords/Pagoda/Star) with thirteen values each, corresponding to Western bridge cards. The Ace is the highest card in each suit, the Two the lowest. Tens rank between Nines and Jacks. Four special cards complete the deck to 56 cards: the Dragon, the Phoenix, the Dog, and the Mah Jong.

### The Two Partners
The two partners of the two Tichu teams sit opposite each other in the circle and strive to provide each other with opportunities to play and score points.

### Before the Game Starts
The winner of the last round shuffles the deck, allows cutting, and places it in the center of the table. Chinese people don't deal cards; they take them! The dealer takes the top card first. Then, everyone takes cards one by one in turn until the deck is exhausted and each has a hand of fourteen cards. Now, cards are exchanged. Each player secretly gives one card from their hand to each other player, thus discarding three cards and receiving three unknown ones. Of course, you can only pick up the new cards after giving away your own three.

### The Game
The game starts with the holder of the Mah Jong. The player to lead may play one of the following combinations in the center of the table:

- A single card (e.g., 4)
- A pair (two cards of the same value, e.g., 8,8)
- A sequence of pairs of consecutive values (e.g., J,J,Q,Q,K,K)
- A triplet (e.g., 2,2,2)
- A full house (triplet + pair, e.g., 5,5,5,9,9)
- A straight of at least five cards (e.g., 4,5,6,7,8,9)

The next player may pass or play a combination of the same type but higher value. A single card can only be beaten by a higher single card, a sequence of two pairs only by a higher sequence of exactly two pairs, a straight of eight cards only by a higher straight of exactly eight cards, a full house only by a higher full house (where the triplet's value determines the ranking). Exception: bombs.

The play continues clockwise. Anyone who passed may re-enter the play at any time. Once all three other players pass in succession, the player who played the last (highest) combination takes the trick and leads again. If that player has no cards left and has finished their hand, the lead passes to the player on their right.

### Special Cards
First, the Mah Jong, an interesting card of dubious reputation:

- Its holder starts the game (but does not have to play the Mah Jong).
- The Mah Jong has a value of 1 and is thus the lowest card in the game. It can be included as a 1 in suitable straights (e.g., 1,2,3,4,5).
- As soon as the player plays the Mah Jong, they have a wish: they may wish for a specific card value (e.g., an 8 or an Ace, but not a special card). The next player who has a card of the wished value and can play it legally must play it (possibly even as a bomb!). If a player does not have the wished value or cannot play it, they may play any legal card or pass. The wish remains until fulfilled.

The loyal Dog has no trick value. It can only be played singly when leading and immediately passes the lead to the partner. (If the partner has already finished, the lead "inherits" to the player on the right.)

The versatile Phoenix is arguably the strongest Tichu card, but counts -25 points in scoring. It can be used as a wonderful joker (of any value from 2 to Ace) in any combination (but does not create a bomb). When played as a single card, its value is ½ above the last played card. (If an 8 is on top, the Phoenix becomes "8½" and can be beaten by cards of 9 or higher. The Phoenix can beat an Ace but not the Dragon.) When leading, the Phoenix has a value of 1½.

The Dragon is the highest single card and counts 25 points. It beats – if singles are being played – even an Ace or an Ace½ (Phoenix on Ace) and is itself only beaten by a bomb. However, it cannot be included in straights, and the noble Dragon gives the trick it won – including its own 25 points – to a player of its choice on the opposing team.

### Bombs
Bombs are straights of at least five consecutive cards of the same suit, or all four cards of the same value. Bombs can be played out of turn to beat any cards. They beat everything, whether a single card or a combination. A higher bomb beats a lower one, with the number of cards determining value first (straights beat four-of-a-kind). Also: if you really want, you can lead with a bomb.

### The Round Ends
Immediately when only one player still holds cards. For scoring, the last player first gives their remaining hand cards to the opposing team and their collected tricks to the round winner (who got rid of their cards first).

Now, Kings and Tens count 10 points each, Fives 5 points each, the Dragon 25 points, and the Phoenix -25 points. The entire deck counts 100 points, which the two teams divide among themselves. If both players of one team achieve a double victory (finishing first and second), scoring is waived: the two add 200 points to their score.

### Tichu!
Tichu is a kind of "Re!" or "Contra!". Until playing their first card, each player has the right to call a "small Tichu". If they win the round (finish first), their team adds 100 extra points; otherwise, 100 points are deducted.

Notes:

- A Tichu is personal. It cannot be pre-arranged with the partner, nor does a partner's victory help – the caller must pull the chestnuts out of the fire themselves.
- The 100 Tichu points are added/deducted in addition to the regular scoring and do not affect it.
- A "Tichu!" can be called even long before playing the first card. Calling before exchanging can be useful: a request to the partner to pass their best card.

Where the small Tichu lurks, the big Tichu is not far behind. Before taking their ninth card, particularly daring or desperate players may call a "big Tichu"... worth 200 extra points.

### The Actual Game Goal
Reach 1000 points. If both teams reach the goal in the same round, the one with the higher total score wins.
